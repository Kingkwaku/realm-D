Installing pip:
Sudo apt install python3-pip
● Why we need pip,
● pip is a package installer in python for install dependencies, just like maven in java.

Install virtualenv:
pip install --upgrade virtualenv Sudo apt install python3-virtualenv
● Why we need to install virtual env through pip
● Pip will recognize which environment to send its installed libraries.
● Why we need to install virtual env through apt
● Apt is a package installer for linux and virtualenv will create a python virtual environment
dedicated to that project which won't disturb the Operating system python dependencies.

For creating virtual env:
virtualenv -p python3 envname

For activating virtual env:
source /path/to/venvfolder/bin/activate

For deactivating:
deactivate
